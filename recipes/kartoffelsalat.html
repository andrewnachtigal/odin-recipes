    <h4>Austrian kartoffelsalat</h4>
    <p1>recipe description
        We're all familiar with American and German potato salads, but less so 
        with their Austrian counterpart, a lighter, brighter version of the dish 
        that's simultaneously more refreshing (there's no mayonnaise in it, and
         relatively little fat overall) and deeper in flavor, thanks to the 
         incorporation of chicken broth and the savoriness it brings. It's 
         flavored with onions, vinegar, and mustard (sometimes with a bit of 
         chopped gherkin), and bound together in a light sauce that gains its 
         creaminess solely from the natural starch found in the potatoes.

    <!-- List of Ingredients -->
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (1kg) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, quartered</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (90g) minced red onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (6g) minced fresh chives</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (about 10g) sugar</li>
        <li>Freshly ground white or black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <ol>
        <li>Place sliced potatoes in a large saucier or Dutch oven and cover with water. Season generously with salt. Place potato skins in a fine-mesh strainer and place on top of pot. Add just enough water to submerge potato skins. Bring to a boil over high heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Discard potato skins, drain potatoes, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle with 2 tablespoons (30ml) vinegar and set aside to cool. When they are cool enough to handle, transfer potatoes to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add remaining vinegar, olive oil, mustard, red onion, chives, chicken stock, and sugar. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, roughly stir and fold mixture so that potatoes release some starch and liquid begins to thicken a little. Season to taste with more salt and white or black pepper. Set aside to rest for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight. (If resting longer than 4 hours, cover bowl and transfer to refrigerator.) Stir again vigorously to thicken dressing; it should have a loose but not soupy consistency. If it's too thick, thin it out with a little extra water or chicken stock and re-season. Serve cold or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
